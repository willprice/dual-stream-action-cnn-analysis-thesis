# Thesis choices

## Oliver
### Project suggestions
* Using Aleph, an extention of prolog to build theories of malware
  network behaviour
* Something to do with his robotic ants

### Pros
* Good relationship
* He's got an excellent understanding of the topics
* Has already had success in his project domains
* ILP seems interesting
* Working with industry professional
* He's got good industrial contacts
* He thinks that it would be quite easy to find lots of research
  projects
* Has already got a published paper out of it, and the programme
  committee said it was the most interesting topic they'd seen so far.

### Cons
* Can sometimes be a little aloof
* Dima says logic based AI is dead for the time being
* Only interested in one of the projects
* ILP no where near as popular as neural networks

## Dima
Deconvoluting dual stream CNNs to understand what the different layers
have learnt.

### Pros
* Very friendly
* Organised
* Has lots of PhD students
* Would work with PhD student and help with part of their work thus
  gaining experience of what it's like
* Deep learning is super hot right now -> should I care about trendiness
  of my project?
* Access to hard to get ML resources
* Very fertile research ground, so can probably pivot the research topic
  quite easily

### Cons
* Do I want to do CV? What could I do afterwards with it?
* Could be challenging and time consuming, Dima said she wouldn't offer
  it to just anyone... potentially a good thing if I do well, although
  if it goes badly then could be a big time sink.

## Kerstin
### Projects
* Applying the 'e' language to robotic verification (rosie = ROS + 'e')
* Driving robots reactive behaviour with virtual agents
* Verification techniques in the games domain

### Pros
* Kerstin is super organised
* Jamie recommends her and he got 2nd best thesis last year
* Excellent industry contacts
* Has funding for interesting visits abroad
* A good door opener into the verification industry if I want to go that
  way.
* Robotic verification could potentially become a big domain
* Keen on involving more people in the project, e.g. Jason if he's
  interested.

### Cons
* Not very sexy projects
* Annoying to front load due to not having covered Design Verification
  course, although this probably isn't that important given my prior
  experience.

## Nick Wu
Would want me to come up with my own project
### Pros
* Highly recommended by many people
* Interesting prior projects
### Cons
* Don't know him very well, he might not know how much to push me.
