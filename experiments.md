- [x] Reproduce excitation backprop results
- [x] Run excitation backprop on a different object recognition network
- [x] Run excitation backprop on the spatial stream of the two-stream network trained on BEOID
- [x] Run excitation backprop on the temporal stream of the two-stream network trained on BEOID
- [x] Reproduce list of flow u,v frames for input into temporal stream from matlab
- [] Validate temporal stream of BEOID trained network achieves similar results to Davide's
- [x] Run excitation backprop on a different temporal trained net on different
     dataset (e.g https://github.com/yjxiong/caffe/tree/action_recog/models/action_recognition)
- [-] Dump flow from a bunch of methods and compare to see how much they differ
- [] Desaturate images to grayscale and plot attention maps
- [] Test different color maps on excitation maps
- [] Test with and without contrastive attention
