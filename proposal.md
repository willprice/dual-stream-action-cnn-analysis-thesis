title: Understanding and Visualising Single and Multi-Stream Convolutional Neural Networks through Deconvolution
---

Supervised by Dima Damen

Convolutional neural networks produce best in class results on many
types of learning problems, yet compared to previous techniques their
decisions are very opaque as feature selection is an implicit step in
the training process. I propose to study the deconvolution of CNNs to
understand the features during training in order to understand the
knowledge learnt by the network [1]. Moreover, I will have access to
pretrained two-stream neural networks for action recognition [2].
Deconvolution on multi-stream neural networks has not been attempted and
part of my work will be to attempt this, including potentially creating
a tool to enable visualising responses of such deconvolution,
